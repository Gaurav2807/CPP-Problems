![CPP Interview Questions SS](https://github.com/Gaurav2807/CPP-Problems/blob/master/CPP%20Interview%20Questions%20SS.png)

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for the respective problem statements in C++ language. It is made with the intention to get familiar with git and github and know how to collaborate and work.

The repository contains various folders which are categorised into different categories and contains questions as per their name specified.

You may refer to "Index.txt" file to see the topics covered.

## Current status
As of now I have started with General Problems folder. It contains basic and easy questions which one needs to know if they are preparing for the service based companies.

## Target Audience
Students and professionals who prefer concrete examples and practice problems over theoretical study. 
Candidates preparing for "Employability Tests"   

## You can contribute by :
1. Fixing the errors.
2. Adding proper and easy to understand documentation. (I have added documentation to some of the codes, you may refer to those questions)
3. Explaining the problem or concept.
4. Writing the steps of execution of program at start.
5. Writing Time and Space complexity for the given programme.

## Point to Remember :
1. For the sake of ease in search of programs, the nomenclature of programs has been done in "1. Programme name.cpp" format, which is absolutely wrong as per the guidelines provided    for the nomenclature of a C++ program. So the programs will not run directly. Please reset the name of program correctly in order to run it.
