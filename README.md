# CPP-Problems
This repository contains solutions of the questions in C++ language. It is made with the intention to get familiar with git and github and know how to collaborate and work.

The repository contains various folders which are categorised into different categories and contains questions as per their name specified.

As of now I have started with General Problems folder. It contins the basic and easy questions which one needs to know if they are preparing for thr service based companies.

You can contribute by :
1. Fixing the errors.
2. Adding proper and easy to understand documentation. (I have added documentation to some of the codes, you may refer to those questions)
